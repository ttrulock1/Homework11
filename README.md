# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

Taking care of the requirements first:
When user opens the Note Taker, then user is presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. When user clicks on the link to the notes page then user is presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
When user enters a new note title and the note’s text then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page. When user click on the Save icon, then the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
When user click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, then that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
